This is a very quick write-up of how to add a new language
wiktionary to the inputs.
This is primarily for the single-language dictionaries,
though it can also be used to improve the quality of
translation dictionaries.
This is all from memory, so there are likely steps missing,
please send a pull request to improve it!

- edit data/downloadInputs.sh:
  - copy/modify one of the sections, only changing the L=en part to
    match the language, e.g. L=nl for Dutch
- run that script to download the data

- in src/com/hughes/android/dictionary/parser/wiktionary/WiktionaryLangs.java extend wikiCodeToIsoCodeToWikiName
  - something like:
        isoCodeToWikiName = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        wikiCodeToIsoCodeToWikiName.put("nl", isoCodeToWikiName); // language code of newly added language
        isoCodeToWikiName.put("code", "Pattern"); // if "Pattern" is found that signals an entry for language "code"

- in src/com/hughes/android/dictionary/engine/WiktionarySplitter.java
  - in endPage function extend the list of sections to ignore/filter out
  - check that headingStartPattern regex works for the language

- run ./compile.sh to compile the code
- run ./WiktionarySplitter.sh to parse and split the downloaded files
- you should get files matching the new language like data/inputs/wikiSplit/nl/NL.data

- edit generate_dictionaries.sh to generate the new dictionaries.
  - e.g. add nl to the SINGLE_DICTS=... list
  - to speed up testing, you can disable generating all other dictionaries
